    "Player experience is too vague. It does not specify whether it is experience with Minecraft or with games in general. We also do not know how each player is classified, since it is difficult to categorize skill level, especially in Minecraft, a non-competitive game. What was measured to determine it? Additionally, what makes a player a “Pro?” What about an “Amateur?”\n",
    "The sample size is too small. This issue is especially prevalent in the “gender” variable because there is only one entry for “Other” players and two entries for “Agender” players.\n",
    "I will assume subscribed means the specific player is subscribed to the newsletter."

    "# Method and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm will be used to predict the quantitative variable,  “played_hours,” using the provided demographics (3 predictors: experience, gender, and age). From the preliminary data analysis and visualization, not all variables have a linear relationship with “played_hours,” therefore, linear regression would have reduced accuracy vs. k-nearest neighbours. KNN performance decreases when the data is sparse, scarce, and contains outliers. I will assume the dataset is large enough for KNN to be “good enough.” A limitation I will look out for is the fact that KNN does not work with categorical data as predictors (“experience” and “gender” variables), so I will try to wrangle the data into something that works. If KNN seems impossible, I may switch methods.\n",

    "-I will create the recipe and model using the training data, then combine them into a workflow. \\\n",
    "-The model will be tuned with cross-validation and tune_grid() to select the optimal k-value with minimal RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). \\\n",
    "-I will redo the model using the optimal k-value, then combine the model and existing recipe into another workflow. \\\n",
    "-I can now predict “played_hours” on the testing data.\n"
